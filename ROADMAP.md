# Digital Garden v2 — Roadmap

Custom React/Vite digital garden. Live at `subsurfaces.net`, wiki at `wiki.subsurfaces.net`.

---

## Completed

### Core Platform
- [x] React 19 + Vite 6 + TanStack Router + Zustand + SCSS modules
- [x] MDX build-time compilation via `@mdx-js/rollup` (120 notes)
- [x] Prebuild pipeline: content-index, graph, slug-map, music, folders, photography manifests
- [x] Catch-all routing with system page slugs (graph, chess, photography, bookshelf, movieshelf, music-library)
- [x] CF Workers deployment with custom domains (subsurfaces.net, www, wiki)

### Layout System
- [x] Article layout: 900px body, Tufte-style sidenotes, TOC, WikiInfobox for chatter/philosopher types
- [x] Note layout: exploration mode, panel stacking, link previews
- [x] Layout auto-resolution: frontmatter → type → slug prefix → default
- [x] `NoteRenderer` + `NoteBody` unified content loading

### Shell & Navigation
- [x] AppShell: BgCanvas + workspace + PanelStack + floating overlays
- [x] WikiShell: lean wiki subdomain shell (no BgCanvas, no music, no panels)
- [x] TerminalTitle: boot sequence, idle animations, wiki context support
- [x] CornerMenu: mobile arc menu with wiki variant
- [x] QuickControls: desktop top-right strip (music, search, theme, clock)
- [x] Panel system: capture-phase click interceptor, depth-aware trimming, card animations

### Features
- [x] BgCanvas: graph/vectors/dots/terminal/chess modes
- [x] Music player: persistent audio, FFT visualiser, mobile strip
- [x] Search: FlexSearch + Ctrl+K overlay
- [x] Graph: D3 force sim + PixiJS renderer, local radar + global overlay
- [x] Chess: chess.js + custom board + Stockfish WASM
- [x] Photography: masonry grid + lightbox
- [x] Collections: bookshelf, movieshelf, music library (auto-collected from frontmatter)
- [x] Theme system: dark/light toggle, ROYGBIV accent cycle, palette generation

### Wiki Subdomain
- [x] `wiki.subsurfaces.net` Worker custom domain configured
- [x] `useIsWiki` hook (hostname + VITE_WIKI_MODE detection)
- [x] WikiShell with BgCanvas, QuickControls, breadcrumb, simplified CornerMenu
- [x] Wiki content: index, Philosophers, Concepts, Movements, Chatters sections
- [x] Wiki index routing: `wiki.subsurfaces.net/` correctly resolves to `Wiki/index.md`
- [x] Case-insensitive `contentIndex` lookup via `resolveSlug` — fixes titles/metadata on all wiki pages

### Wiki Submission System
- [x] `src/worker.ts` — CF Worker entry point handles `POST /api/submit` (Turnstile + GitHub PR)
- [x] `WikiSubmitPage.tsx` — 4-step form: basic info → survey (35 questions) → page body editor → review
- [x] Survey dropdowns include "Other…" option with inline free-text input
- [x] Markdown editor with toolbar, word count, MDX syntax guide
- [x] Profile image: upload file or paste URL; committed to `content/Media/Wiki/chatters/` on PR branch
- [x] Draft save/load: `localStorage` auto-restore, download/upload `.json` draft file
- [x] Upload draft on step 1 — jumps straight to review step
- [x] Submissions create PR against `master` branch with `tags: [wiki, chatter]`
- [x] Turnstile + GitHub token configured in CF Worker runtime secrets
- [x] End-to-end submission verified in production

### Infrastructure
- [x] OG image generation: satori + @resvg/resvg-js, per-note thumbnail (cover/image/poster), description linting
- [x] OG meta tag injection in `src/worker.ts` — per-route `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `twitter:card`
- [x] Wiki subdomain gets "Philchat Wiki" branding in OG/title tags
- [x] `public/og/` gitignored — generated fresh at CF build time via `PROCESS_OG=true`
- [x] DNS: Cloudflare nameservers, Worker custom domains for all subdomains
- [x] SPA routing: `wrangler.toml` `[assets]` + `not_found_handling = "single-page-application"`
- [x] Default theme: light mode, blue accent (`#427ab4`)

## In Progress / Next Up

### Wiki Subdomain UX Fixes
- [x] **Submit page 404 in wiki subdomain**: added dedicated `/submit` route in router (before catch-all) rendering `WikiSubmitPage`
- [x] **Tag/folder pages unconstrained width in wiki**: removed `tags`/`folder` from article slug list in `resolveLayout`; also fixed `NoteBody` frontmatter override to not force article layout for tag/folder pages
- [x] **Search overlay links broken in wiki**: `handleSelect` now uses `navigate()` in wiki mode instead of `pushCard` (which requires PanelStack)
- [x] **TerminalTitle home button**: wiki logo now links to `/` (wiki root) instead of `https://subsurfaces.net`
- [x] **Tag/folder links not navigating in wiki**: `usePanelClick` was intercepting all clicks (hooks run before conditional shell return) — added `isWiki` bail-out so wiki lets links navigate normally
- [x] **Cross-domain backlinks broken in wiki**: backlinks to non-wiki slugs now link to `https://subsurfaces.net/{slug}` instead of `/{slug}`, preventing the wiki router from swallowing them

### Styling & UX Fixes
- [x] **TOC hash link fix**: `usePanelClick` intercepts `#hash` clicks — add early return for anchor links so TOC smooth-scrolls in both layouts
- [x] **Tag/Folder page headings**: add `<h1>` to TagPage and FolderPage (currently render lists with no heading)
- [x] **Infobox persistence bug**: WikiInfobox remains visible when navigating from a chatter/philosopher page to a non-infobox page — state not clearing on slug change
- [x] **Search overlay light mode**: styling broken in light theme
- [x] **Link preview simplification**: body content shown on hover (fetched from public/content/), recursive hover with depth cap, OPEN button pushes panel card
- [x] **Triadic colour harmony**: JS hue-rotation generates secondary/tertiary from accent; applied to callouts, blockquotes, growth badges, BgCanvas palette, TOC active state

### Wiki Content & Structure
- [x] **Wiki frontmatter cleanup**: add explicit `type` fields where semantically appropriate (chatters, philosophers); leave slug-based article rule as fallback
- [x] **Wiki tag taxonomy**: standardised tags (`philosopher`, `chatter`, `concept`, `movement`) on all wiki content; section links on index page route to `/tags/{type}`
- [x] **Wiki index redesign**: make it a proper hub page — section links (tag-based), recent additions, community stats
- [x] **Wiki page organisation**: establish standard wiki pages (index, about, guidelines, submit)

### Note Transclusion (Note Embeds)
- [x] **`![[Note]]` inline embed**: renders as styled `<aside class="note-embed">` block — header with label + link, body content, "open note" footer
- [x] **`![[Note#Section]]` heading-scoped embed**: extracts content under the specified heading at build time
- [x] **2-level depth limit**: `embedDepth` option prevents recursion beyond depth 2 (falls back to plain link)
- [x] **Broken embed detection**: warns at build time when `![[Target]]` cannot be resolved

### Content Features
- [x] **Reading time**: calculated at build time in prebuild, stored in content-index, shown in article header
- [x] **Broken link detection**: prebuild pass warns on `[[wikilinks]]` that don't resolve in slug-map; skips media file extensions and code-block/backtick-span false positives
- [x] **`contentPath` in index**: original relative path stored in content-index so runtime fetches use correct casing on CF's case-sensitive Linux filesystem
- [x] **Note aliases**: `aliases: [Name, AltName]` frontmatter → added to slug-map at prebuild, resolves from any alias
- [x] **`/recent` page**: notes sorted by `date` descending, similar to folder page layout
- [x] **Dataview-lite**: `<Query filter="type=book" sort="-date" limit="5" display="list|grid|table" />` MDX component — filters/sorts contentIndex at runtime, registered in MDXProvider; `<Query>` fix: components passed explicitly via props to bypass MDX context lookup issue

### UX Polish
- [x] **Breadcrumbs on articles**: `Folder / Subfolder / Note` derived from slug, shown above title in article layout
- [x] **Export / print styles**: `@media print` CSS — hides shell chrome, full-width content, sidenotes inline
- [x] **Hover previews**: body text fetched from `public/content/` using `contentPath` from index (preserves original filename casing); wikilinks rendered as hoverable `<a>` tags; first image shown as full-width header; HTML SPA-fallback rejection via `content-type` check; recursive hover to depth 4; OPEN button pushes panel card

### Dev Tools
- [x] **Properties editor redesign**: floating glass panel (bottom-right, no overlay, glassmorphism), session-override fields (title, type, tags)
- [x] **Admin consolidation**: DevDashboard already consolidates content index, note browser, store state, actions — using CSS variables throughout for light/dark support

### Typography & Content
- [x] **Tufte sidenotes in article layout**: `remarkSidenotes` plugin converts GFM footnotes (`[^1]`) at remark stage (rehype-level approach failed in MDX); injects `<aside class="sidenote">` after the containing block; floats into right margin at `>1101px`, checkbox toggle on narrow viewports
- [x] **Obsidian callouts**: `>[!type] Title` syntax renders as styled callout divs; fixed single-node collapse (remark-gfm collapses blockquote continuations into one `\n`-joined text node — plugin now splits on first `\n`)
- [x] **External link styling**: `href^="http"` links not pointing to `subsurfaces.net` get muted colour + `↗` superscript arrow; print stylesheet updated to show full URL only for external links
- [x] **WikiInfobox image expand**: clicking avatar opens fullscreen lightbox overlay; click backdrop to close; `cursor: zoom-in` hint
- [x] **`Writing/` slug → article layout**: `resolveLayout` now returns `article` for any `writing/` slug without needing `layout: article` in frontmatter (though frontmatter still wins)
- [x] **`rehypeImagePaths` double-prefix fix**: strips leading `media/` or `Media/` before prepending `/content/Media/` — prevents `media/media/` doubling when images are referenced from sidenotes or raw HTML
- [x] **Sample writing note**: `content/Writing/On-Attention.md` — demos dropcap, pullquote, callouts, sidenotes with wikilink + external link + image, `<Query>` component, `published: true` for RSS
- [x] **Writing template**: `content/Writing/Writing-Template.md` — style reference covering all supported features with inline examples
- [x] **Note embed HTML rendering**: embed body now parsed via `mdast-util-from-markdown` + `hast-util-to-html` — was injecting raw markdown as text
- [x] **EB Garamond dropcap**: loaded via Google Fonts; upright 400, `5.4em`, `clear: right` on pullquote prevents sidenote overlap; `z-index: 1` prevents text overlap
- [x] **`Query` filter key fix**: filter key is `tag=` not `tags=`; fixed in template and On-Attention
- [x] **`Query` date formatting**: raw `Date.toString()` output (e.g. `Sat Mar 07 2026 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)`) now formatted to short date (`Sat, 07 Mar 2026`) or with short timezone (`Sat, 07 Mar 2026, 12:00 GMT`) when time is specified

### Performance & Build
- [ ] **Chess performance**: investigate Stockfish WASM latency on local builds
- [ ] **Pre-render SSG**: build-time HTML generation for all notes
- [ ] **Image optimisation**: sharp WebP variants + `<picture>` srcsets
- [ ] **Lighthouse CI**: GitHub Actions target 95+ desktop
- [x] **Auto-deploy on merge**: CF Workers auto-builds on push via `wrangler.toml` `[build]` command — no GitHub Actions needed
- [ ] **OG gen: SVG image support**: satori cannot load `.svg` images from Wikipedia/external sources — throws "Unsupported image type: unknown". Affects any note whose `image`/`cover` frontmatter points to an SVG URL. Fix: detect SVG URLs in `og-gen.ts` and skip the image, or rasterise via `sharp` before passing to satori. Currently crashes silently and falls back to text-only OG card. Affected note: any using `https://upload.wikimedia.org/...svg` cover images.
- [ ] **OG gen: external image fetch failures**: `https://covers.openlibrary.org/...` fetch fails in CF build environment (likely blocked). Fix: catch fetch errors per-image and fall back gracefully rather than crashing the OG generator. Both SVG and fetch-failure cases should be handled together.
- [ ] **OG caching not working**: build log shows `132 image(s) to generate (0 cached)` on every build — cache is never hit. OG images are being regenerated from scratch each deploy (~90s added to build time). Investigate cache key / hash logic in `og-gen.ts` and ensure the cache directory persists between CF builds (may need to use CF build output cache or commit generated images).
- [ ] **Prebuild runs twice per CF deploy**: build log shows prebuild running once standalone (for OG gen) and again as part of `npm run build`. Combined with `wrangler deploy` triggering its own `npm run build`, this means prebuild runs 3× total per deploy. Investigate deduplication — consider splitting OG gen into a separate script not called by `prebuild`.
- [x] **`_template` compiled as MDX chunk**: `dist/assets/_template-c5OcOr94.js` appears in the bundle — `content/Photos/_template.md` is being picked up by `import.meta.glob` and compiled. Add `_template` to the MDX glob exclusion pattern in `vite.config.ts` or rename to avoid the glob.
- [x] **Static/dynamic import conflict (5→2 warnings)**: `BookshelfPage`, `MovieshelfPage`, `MusicPage`, `ChessPage`, `GraphView` converted to lazy imports in `NoteBody` and `GraphOverlay`. 2 remaining warnings are `TagPage`/`FolderPage` (lightweight, statically imported in router — no perf impact).
- [x] **Main bundle 698KB (212KB gzip)**: reduced from 1.13MB/350KB by fixing static/dynamic import conflicts — heavy modules (chess.js, D3, PixiJS) now properly split into lazy chunks.
- [ ] **`glob@11` deprecation warning**: `npm warn deprecated glob@11.1.0` on every install. Not a breaking issue but should be tracked — update when a direct or transitive dependency releases a fix.

### Desktop Performance (Lighthouse score: 37 — critical)
> Measured on desktop. FCP 3.6s, LCP 6.8s, TBT 130ms, CLS 0.353. Total payload 7.2MB. Same root causes as mobile — sourcemaps shipping to clients, no code splitting.

- [x] **Disable production sourcemaps**: `sourcemap: true` in `vite.config.ts` is shipping `.map` files to the browser — 4MB+ of the 7.2MB payload. Set `sourcemap: false` for production.
- [x] **Code splitting**: add `build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks` to split `d3`, `pixi.js`, `flexsearch`, `chess.js` into separate chunks — prevents all heavy libs loading on initial page paint
- [x] **Create robots.txt**: `public/robots.txt` is missing entirely — Lighthouse logged 25 errors. Add a valid file.
- [x] **Font display swap**: verified — Google Fonts URL has `display=swap`; no local `@font-face` rules exist in SCSS
- [x] **`<main>` landmark**: wrap main content in `<main>` element for accessibility + SEO (currently missing, flagged by both Lighthouse runs)
- [x] **Heading order**: fixed `h1`→`h2`→`h3` sequence — ChessPage `h4`→`h2`, MusicPage `h3`→`h2`, NoteFooter `h3`→`h2`, TableOfContents `h3`→`<span>` (non-semantic label)

### Mobile Performance (Lighthouse score: 12 — critical)
> Measured on mobile. FCP 21.4s, LCP 43.6s, TBT 1,270ms, CLS 0.399. Total payload 7.2MB. Root cause: enormous unminified/unused JS bundle and eager loading of heavy libraries.

- [x] **Enable Vite minification**: `sourcemap: false` + no disabled minify — fixed alongside sourcemap removal
- [x] **Reduce unused JS**: split vendor chunks done — `d3`, `pixi.js`, `flexsearch`, `chess.js` in own chunks
- [x] **BgCanvas: skip on mobile**: early return added — canvas never mounts on `≤800px`
- [x] **Fix CLS (partial)**: added `@font-face` fallbacks with `size-adjust`, `ascent-override`, `descent-override` in `base.scss` for all three fonts; updated `--font-*` tokens to include fallbacks. Image `width`/`height` attributes remain TODO (affects Gallery, sidenotes, link preview, lightbox)
- [x] **Fix render-blocking requests** (est. 300ms savings): `index.html` Google Fonts now use `rel="preload"` + `onload` swap + `<noscript>` fallback
- [x] **Cache lifetimes** (est. 122KB savings): `public/_headers` sets 1-year immutable cache on `/content/Media/*` and `/assets/*`, 7-day cache on `/og/*`

### Bundle & Loading Optimisations (identified via deep audit)
> LocalGraph imports D3 + PixiJS at module level — 570KB loaded on every desktop page even when the graph widget isn't visible. content-index.json (81KB) fetched before first render. chess.js in manualChunks forces a separate request even though ChessPage is already lazy-loaded.

- [x] **chess.js removed from manualChunks**: was creating a separate chunk that loaded independently; now co-bundled with lazy ChessPage
- [x] **LocalGraph: lazy import D3 + PixiJS**: moved to dynamic `import()` in AppShell — 570KB (D3 + PixiJS) no longer in the initial bundle
- [x] **content-index.json deferred**: moved fetch out of `main.tsx` startup into AppShell `useEffect` — no longer blocks initial React render
- [x] **Trim Google Font weights**: removed unused variants — EB Garamond down to 1 variant (was 6), Playfair down to 4 (was 5), IBM Plex Mono down to 2 (was 3); saves ~30-40KB of font data
- [x] **FlexSearch index: defer to first search open**: index now only built on first `isOpen=true` — no CPU cost if user never searches
- [x] **BgCanvas: skip graph.json fetch unless in graph mode**: `graph.json` (18KB) now only fetched when `bgMode === "graph"` — saves a network request on every other background mode
- [x] **`<main>` landmark**: wrap main content area in `<main>` element — missing, flagged by Lighthouse for accessibility + SEO

### Content Housekeeping
- [ ] **37 broken wikilinks**: build log reports 37 unresolved `[[wikilinks]]` across 14 notes. Highest priority clusters:
  - `Moltbook` → 10 broken links (private/draft notes not in repo: `[[OpenClaw]]`, `[[Hyperstition]]`, `[[The-Claude-Bliss-Attractor]]`, etc.) — consider either creating stub notes or removing links
  - `Writing/On-Attention` → 5 broken links (`[[Philosophy-of-Mind]]`, `[[Wittgenstein]]`, `[[Wiki/Concepts/index]]`) — create stubs or fix slugs
  - `index` → `[[Music]]`, `[[Tags]]` — slug mismatch; likely should be `music-library` and `tags`
  - `Wiki/Concepts`, `Wiki/Movements` → `[[Sample-Article]]` — placeholder link from wiki template, remove or replace
  - One-offs: `[[Walter-Benjamin]]`, `[[Kodachrome]]`, `[[Lars-von-Trier]]`, `[[Abbas]]`, `[[08-11-25]]`, `[[Thomas-Sauvin]]`, `[[Rabbit-Holes]]`, `[[Narrative-hooks]]`, `[[Literary-orientations]]`, `[[Rosi-Braidotti]]` — create stubs or fix slugs

### Content & SEO
- [x] **Sitemap** in prebuild (sitemap.xml → public/)
- [x] **`image` field in content-index**: extracted from frontmatter (`image`/`cover`/`poster`) for OG and meta use
- [x] **RSS feeds (two, opt-in)**: `public/rss.xml` (Writing/ or `published: true`, non-wiki) + `public/wiki-rss.xml` (wiki/ + `published: true`); both generated in prebuild; `published` extracted into content-index; undated notes excluded; fixed wiki feed link text to say `wiki.subsurfaces.net`. `content/Writing/` folder ready — add notes there or set `published: true` + `date` on any note to include it.
- [x] **robots.txt created**: `public/robots.txt` was missing entirely — created with `Allow: /` + sitemap reference; fixes 25 Lighthouse SEO errors
- [x] **Meta descriptions**: already injected by `src/worker.ts` `injectMetaTags()` using `description` ?? `excerpt` frontmatter fields
- [x] **`description` field in content-index**: already extracted in `prebuild.ts`, present in `NoteMetadata` type, used by worker's `injectMetaTags()` for OG + meta description
- [ ] **Detailed documentation**: comprehensive docs for the codebase (delegate to worker agent)

### Photography Albums
- [x] **Album system**: `content/Photos/*.md` frontmatter-driven albums → `public/albums.json`; `<PhotoAlbums />` MDX component renders album grid → drill-in masonry → lightbox with keyboard nav
- [x] **`_template.md`**: album template in `content/Photos/` for adding new albums without code changes
- [x] **Photography.md restored**: written content now renders normally; `<PhotoAlbums />` appended below prose

### Bug Fixes
- [x] **`class` → `className` in MDX content**: raw HTML in `.md` files compiled as JSX — `class=` attribute causes React warnings. Fixed in: `Chess.md`, `Photography.md`, `Writing/Writing-Template.md`, `Writing/On-Attention.md`, `Wiki/chatters/hughchungus.md`, `thinking in public.md`, `Wiki/Philsurvey Template.md`
- [x] **Telescopic wikilink slugs**: `[[Note Name]]` inside telescopic blocks was generating `href="/Note Name"` (spaces, not hyphens) — now slugified to `href="/note-name"` matching runtime resolver
- [x] **`usePanelClick` stale `tracks` closure**: music link handler closed over empty `tracks` array (before `music.json` loaded) — `tracks` added to `useEffect` deps
- [x] **`music:` link handler matching**: `NoteBody` was calling `playTrack(slug)` but `playTrack` matches by `t.slug` (`"Music/Eden"`) not by name — now matches by `t.title` (case-insensitive), consistent with `usePanelClick`; also opens music player if closed
- [x] **Panel card top padding**: note body in panel cards was overlapping QuickControls — top padding increased to `4rem`
- [x] **`usePanelClick` slug normalisation**: slug extracted from clicked URL now normalises spaces → hyphens before passing to panel/store
- [x] **Graph overlay close on node click**: clicking a node in the GraphOverlay now closes the overlay before opening the panel card

### Security Headers (Best Practices score: 77)
- [x] **CSP (Content Security Policy)**: `addSecurityHeaders()` in `src/worker.ts` — scoped to own origins, Google Fonts, Supabase, Turnstile, external image CDNs; `frame-ancestors 'none'`
- [x] **HSTS**: `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
- [x] **COOP**: `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`
- [x] **XFO / framing**: `X-Frame-Options: DENY` + CSP `frame-ancestors 'none'`
- [x] **Additional**: `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- [ ] **Trusted Types**: evaluate `require-trusted-types-for 'script'` — may conflict with PixiJS/D3 dynamic DOM writes, audit first

## Comments System

Opt-in per-note comments. Turnstile-gated, no login required. Pseudonymous (name only). Stored in Cloudflare D1 via the existing Worker. Hierarchical replies, upvote/downvote. Available site-wide (wiki + main), styled to match the active shell.

### D1 Database Setup
- [ ] Create D1 database via Wrangler: `npx wrangler d1 create digital-garden-comments`
- [ ] Add `[[d1_databases]]` binding to `wrangler.toml`: `binding = "DB", database_name = "digital-garden-comments"`
- [ ] Add `DB: D1Database` to `Env` interface in `src/worker.ts`
- [ ] Run schema migration via `wrangler d1 execute`:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE comments (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    slug TEXT NOT NULL,
    parent_id TEXT,
    author TEXT NOT NULL,
    body TEXT NOT NULL,
    upvotes INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    downvotes INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL
  );
  CREATE INDEX idx_comments_slug ON comments(slug);
  ```

### Worker API Endpoints (src/worker.ts)
- [ ] `GET /api/comments?slug=...` — fetch all comments for a slug (ordered by created_at, tree structure assembled client-side)
- [ ] `POST /api/comments` — submit a new comment: validate Turnstile token, validate name + body (non-empty, length limits), insert into D1, return created comment
- [ ] `POST /api/comments/:id/vote` — body `{ dir: 1 | -1 }`: increment upvotes or downvotes on a comment row
- [ ] `DELETE /api/comments/:id` — admin-only delete: requires `Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_SECRET>` header; add `ADMIN_SECRET` to Worker secrets
- [ ] Add `ADMIN_SECRET` to Worker runtime secrets in CF dashboard

### Frontend — CommentSection Component
- [ ] Create `src/components/ui/CommentSection.tsx`:
  - Fetches comments on mount via `GET /api/comments?slug={slug}`
  - Assembles flat list into tree (parent_id → children) client-side
  - Renders top-level comments first (oldest first, LessWrong style)
  - Each comment shows: author, relative timestamp, body, upvote/downvote buttons, reply button
  - Upvote/downvote calls `POST /api/comments/:id/vote` and updates count optimistically
  - Reply button opens inline reply form below the comment
  - Submit form at the bottom of the comment list (top-level new comment)
- [ ] Create `src/components/ui/CommentSection.module.scss` — styled to CSS variables, works in both dark/light, both shells
- [ ] Submit form fields: Name (text, required), Comment (textarea, required), Turnstile widget, Submit button
- [ ] Inline reply form: same fields, nested visually under parent
- [ ] Loading + error states

### Integration
- [ ] Add `comments?: boolean` to `NoteMetadata` in `src/types/content.ts`
- [ ] Extract `comments` field in `scripts/prebuild.ts` (add to `NoteMeta`, write to content-index)
- [ ] In `NoteRenderer.tsx`: if `meta?.comments` is true, render `<CommentSection slug={slug} />` below `<NoteFooter>`
- [ ] `CommentSection` uses `useIsWiki()` to determine which domain's API to call (both domains share the same Worker, so `/api/comments` works on both)

### Opt-in
- [ ] Add `comments: true` to any note frontmatter to enable the section
- [ ] Suggested initial candidates: `content/Wiki/index.md`, chatter profiles

## Wiki Contributor Experience

### Phase 1: Visible Auth & Signup ✓
- [x] Auth controls in WikiShell header (bottom-left): "Log in / Sign up" when logged out, username + role badge + dropdown when logged in
- [x] WikiAuthModal: Login + Signup tabs; signup validates username (3-30 chars) + checks uniqueness
- [x] `useAuth` exposes `username`, `bio`, `avatar_url`, `created_at`; adds `signUp()` and `updateProfile()` methods
- [x] Worker: `GET /api/auth/me` returns full profile fields; `PUT /api/auth/profile`; `POST /api/auth/register`; auto-creates profile row on first login

### Phase 2: User Profile Pages ✓
- [x] `WikiProfilePage` — username, role badge, join date ("joined {date}" from `profiles.created_at`), contribution count, bio (inline-editable), edit history table, bookmarks list
- [x] Username change from own profile page (validated, uniqueness-checked server-side)
- [x] Routes: `/profile` (own) and `/user/:username` (public)

### Phase 3: Editor Improvements ✓
- [x] Markdown preview toggle in `WikiMarkdownEditor` (react-markdown + remark-gfm, lazy-loaded)
- [x] Required edit summary field (max 200 chars) on both WikiEditPage and WikiNewPage
- [x] Change summary box: "+N lines added, -M removed" shown before submit in WikiEditPage

### Bookmarks ✓
- [x] `useBookmarks` hook — Supabase-backed when logged in, localStorage fallback when logged out
- [x] Auto-migrates localStorage bookmarks to Supabase on first login
- [x] Bookmark button on all article pages (wiki + main site) in note header
- [x] Bookmarks list on own profile page with remove button
- [x] Worker endpoints: `GET/POST/DELETE /api/bookmarks`, `POST /api/bookmarks/migrate`
- [x] Supabase `bookmarks` table with `UNIQUE(user_id, slug)` constraint

### Future
- [ ] Contributor dashboard (recent activity, stats)
- [ ] Watchlist (get notified when bookmarked pages are edited) — needs Supabase `watchlist` table
- [ ] Page metadata editing (description, tags) from wiki editor UI
- [ ] **Bookmarks: move off AppShell** — `AppShell` currently imports Supabase client for bookmarks, violating the "garden has no Supabase dependency" rule. Bookmarks should live entirely on `wiki.subsurfaces.net`; remove Supabase import from `AppShell` and `useBookmarks` hook from the main site
- [ ] **Supabase RLS audit**: `bookmarks`, `edit_log`, `page_locks` tables have no RLS policies. Acceptable for now (trusted editors only). Before public launch: own-row-only for bookmarks; insert-only for edit_log; admin-only lock management.
- [x] **`signInWithPassword()`** added to `useAuth` — ready for password auth UI
- [x] **Password auth UI**: `WikiAuthModal` login tab now shows email + password fields → `signInWithPassword`; signup still uses magic link for email verification.
- [x] **Dev auto-login**: `VITE_DEV_AUTH_EMAIL` + `VITE_DEV_AUTH_PASSWORD` in `.env.local` — `useAuth` silently calls `signInWithPassword` on mount in dev when no session. Fill in credentials in `.env.local`. Never committed.

---

## Chatter Community Platform

Three interlocking systems: **Chat** (Phase 1), **Stonks** (Phase 2), **Identity & Avatar** (Phase 3). All share the existing Supabase auth and `profiles` table.

**Phase order is strict — do not skip ahead:**
`shared cookie auth` → `chat` → `stonks` → `identity`. Stonks UI must not be built before chat reactions exist to feed it.

**Strict layering — dependencies flow one way only:**
```
subsurfaces.net        (no Supabase dependency — must load if Supabase is down)
       ↓
wiki.subsurfaces.net   (Supabase auth + GitHub API)
       ↓
chat.subsurfaces.net   (Supabase Realtime + stonks ledger)
```
Nothing flows upward. A chat outage must not affect the wiki. A wiki outage must not affect the garden.

**`src/worker.ts` domain routing** — one Worker serves all three domains intentionally. Keep a clear partition comment at the top of the routing block:
```
// garden:  subsurfaces.net        → static assets + OG meta injection
// wiki:    wiki.subsurfaces.net   → auth, editing, profiles, bookmarks
// chat:    chat.subsurfaces.net   → realtime, stonks, bans, GIF search
```

### Phase 1: Chat (`chat.subsurfaces.net`)

#### Infrastructure
- [x] **Shared cookie auth first** — cookie-based `storage` adapter in `src/lib/supabase.ts` writes session to `document.cookie` with `domain=.subsurfaces.net`; falls back to default (localStorage) when `VITE_COOKIE_DOMAIN` unset. Deploy + verify test matrix before building chat UI: login on `wiki.*` → navigate to `chat.*` → still logged in; logout on `chat.*` → `wiki.*` also logged out
- [x] Add `VITE_COOKIE_DOMAIN` env var (`.subsurfaces.net` in `.env`, unset in `.env.local` for localhost dev)
- [x] Add `chat.subsurfaces.net` as a custom domain in `wrangler.toml` (CF dashboard custom domain already added by user)
- [x] `useShell()` hook returning `"main" | "wiki" | "chat"` in `src/hooks/useShell.ts`; `useIsWiki()` and `useIsChat()` are thin wrappers; `src/hooks/useIsWiki.ts` re-exports from `useShell`
- [x] Create `ChatShell.tsx` — lean skeleton shell (no BgCanvas, no panels, no music); `ChatUserMenu` with auth modal; `TerminalTitle context="chat"`
- [x] Add chat shell detection in `AppShell.tsx` — `if (shell === "chat") return <ChatShell />`; content-index fetch guarded to `shell === "main"` only
- [x] **Cross-subdomain auth (shared cookie)**: cookie `storage` adapter in `src/lib/supabase.ts` — `VITE_COOKIE_DOMAIN` controls domain scope; `cookieOptions` field on browser client doesn't work (SSR-only), so custom `storage` adapter used instead
- [x] `VITE_CHAT_MODE=true` env var support in `useShell()`; commented out in `.env.local` with instructions
- [x] `usePanelClick` updated: `isWiki` bail-out replaced with `shell !== "main"` — also bails on chat
- [ ] **Supabase: add `chat.subsurfaces.net` to Auth redirect URLs** — Authentication → URL Configuration → Redirect URLs → add `https://chat.subsurfaces.net/**` and `https://chat.subsurfaces.net`
- [ ] **Verify shared cookie auth in production** — deploy and run test matrix before proceeding to Supabase schema

#### Supabase Schema
- [x] `rooms` table created + seeded (`general`, `philosophy`)
- [x] `messages` table created with FTS index + `(room_id, created_at DESC)` index
- [x] `reactions` table with composite PK `(message_id, user_id, emote)`
- [x] Ban fields added to `profiles`: `ban_type`, `ban_expires_at`, `ban_reason`
- [x] RLS policies on `messages`, `reactions`, `rooms` (authenticated read; own insert; own delete for reactions)
- [x] Supabase Realtime enabled on `messages` and `reactions` tables — Dashboard path: **Database → Publications → supabase_realtime → toggle table**. Alternatively via SQL: `alter publication supabase_realtime add table messages; alter publication supabase_realtime add table reactions;`
- [ ] Enable Supabase Realtime **Presence** channel per room (for typing indicators — Phase 1 future)

#### Worker API Endpoints (`src/worker.ts`)
- [x] `GET /api/chat/rooms` — non-archived rooms ordered by name
- [x] `POST /api/chat/rooms` — admin only: create room
- [x] `GET /api/chat/messages?room=&before=&limit=` — paginated history with `profiles` embed + reply_to snapshots
- [x] `DELETE /api/chat/messages/:id` — soft delete (own or admin)
- [x] `POST /api/chat/reactions` — upsert reaction
- [x] `DELETE /api/chat/reactions` — remove own reaction
- [x] `GET /api/chat/search?q=&room=&user=&before=&after=&limit=` — ilike full-text search
- [x] `GET /api/chat/users/:username/mini` — public mini profile
- [x] `POST /api/chat/ban` + `POST /api/chat/unban` — admin only
- [x] `checkBanStatus()` helper — checked on all authenticated chat writes

#### Admin: Bans
- [x] `ban_type`, `ban_expires_at`, `ban_reason` on `profiles`
- [x] Ban check in worker on all authenticated chat writes (messages, reactions)
- [x] `POST /api/chat/ban` / `POST /api/chat/unban` endpoints (admin only)
- [ ] On permanent ban: hard-delete all message rows + anonymise profile (deferred)

#### Frontend — ChatShell & UI
- [x] `ChatShell.tsx` + `ChatShell.module.scss` — IRC-aesthetic shell, auth menu, TerminalTitle "Philchat"
- [x] `ChatPage.tsx` — two-column layout (sidebar + main), room list, login prompt, auto-selects first room
- [x] `ChatRoom.tsx` — Supabase Realtime subscription, pagination, scroll-to-bottom, send handler
- [x] `MessageList.tsx` — grouped consecutive messages, forwardRef scroll, compact rows
- [x] `MessageInput.tsx` — Enter-to-send, char limit, reply preview banner
- [x] `MessageRow.tsx` — avatar, username, timestamp, reply-to bar, deleted state, hover reply button
- [x] `parseMessageBody.ts` — tokeniser: text/emote/image/youtube/url tokens, one-embed guard
- [x] `MessageBodyRenderer` in `MessageRow` — renders tokens: inline images, YouTube click-to-load, links, emotes
- [x] `src/types/chat.ts` — shared `ChatMessage` + `ChatRoom` types
- [x] Router: catch-all `noteRoute` returns `<ChatPage />` when `shell === "chat"`
- [x] `MiniProfilePopup.tsx` — fixed-position popup on username click; avatar, role badge, bio, joined date, stonk placeholder, link to wiki profile
- [x] `TypingIndicator.tsx` — Supabase Presence per room; shared channel via module-level Map; `useTypingBroadcast()` hook for MessageInput integration
- [x] `EmotePicker.tsx` — fetches `/emotes/index.json`, falls back to 8 hardcoded names; filterable grid; inserts `:name:` into input
- [x] `GifPicker.tsx` — debounced search via `GET /api/chat/gif-search`; 2-column preview grid; inserts `![](url)` on select
- [x] `ChatSearch.tsx` — right-panel overlay; query/room/date/media-only filters; calls `GET /api/chat/search`; result list with room+author+body+timestamp
- [x] Reaction strip on `MessageRow` — emote+count buttons, own-highlighted, calls `onReact`
- [x] Delete button on own messages in `MessageRow` — hover-reveal, calls `onDelete`
- [x] `GET /api/chat/gif-search` worker endpoint — proxies KLIPY API (requires `KLIPY_API_KEY` CF secret)
- [x] Commit initial emote set to `public/emotes/` + create `public/emotes/index.json` (55 emotes: 28 GIF + 27 PNG; `{name,ext}[]` format)
- [x] Wire `onReact` / `onDelete` callbacks in `ChatRoom` — optimistic toggle (POST/DELETE), reactions embedded in messages response from worker
- [ ] Add `KLIPY_API_KEY` as CF Worker secret in dashboard

#### Rich Media Rendering (`MessageRow.tsx` + `parseMessageBody.ts`)

All message body rendering goes through a shared `parseMessageBody(text)` utility that splits the body into typed tokens before render. No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` — tokens map to React components.

**Token types and render rules:**

| Token | Detection | Renders as |
|---|---|---|
| `![](url)` | Markdown image syntax (inserted by GIF picker) | `<img>` inline, `max-height: 300px` |
| Image URL | Bare URL ending in `.jpg .jpeg .png .gif .webp` or from known image CDNs (`i.imgur.com`, `pbs.twimg.com`, etc.) | `<img>` inline, `max-height: 300px` |
| YouTube URL | `youtube.com/watch?v=` or `youtu.be/` | Lazy `<iframe>` embed (click-to-load thumbnail first to avoid autoload) |
| Twitter/X URL | `twitter.com/` or `x.com/` + `/status/` | `<blockquote>` placeholder + link; optionally lazy-load Twitter embed script |
| Plain URL | Any other `https?://` URL | `<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">` with URL as label |
| `:emote-name:` | Colon-wrapped token matching a known emote name | `<img src="/emotes/{name}.gif" class="emote">` |
| Plain text | Everything else | Text node |

**Rules:**
- [ ] Create `src/lib/parseMessageBody.ts` — tokeniser returning typed token array
- [ ] GIF picker inserts `![](url)` syntax (not bare URL) — unambiguous signal, no extension sniffing needed for GIFs
- [ ] Image embeds are ephemeral by design — raw user-provided links, no proxying, no caching; broken images show nothing (CSS `img:error { display: none }` or `onError` handler)
- [ ] YouTube: render a static thumbnail (`https://img.youtube.com/vi/{id}/0.jpg`) with a play button overlay; clicking loads the actual `<iframe>` — avoids autoplaying iframes on load
- [ ] Twitter/X: render as a styled link card (username + tweet text if extractable) — avoid loading Twitter's JS embed script by default; optional "load embed" button
- [ ] Max one embed per message to prevent spam walls of iframes
- [ ] All embeds lazy — nothing loads until the message is in the viewport (`IntersectionObserver`)
- [ ] `onError` on all `<img>` tags — hide broken images silently, never show broken image icon in chat

#### Admin Room Management UI
- [ ] Admin-only "+" button in room sidebar → inline form: room name + slug → `POST /api/chat/rooms`
- [ ] Admin can archive a room (removes from sidebar, preserves history)

---

### Phase 2: Stonks

#### Supabase Schema
- [ ] Create `stonk_ledger` table: `id UUID PRIMARY KEY, user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles, amount INTEGER NOT NULL, reason TEXT NOT NULL, source_type TEXT NOT NULL` (e.g. `reaction_received`, `reaction_given`, `profile_created`, `wiki_edit`, `nahh_given`), `source_id TEXT, created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL`
  - Index: `(user_id, created_at DESC)`
  - Balance = `SUM(amount) WHERE user_id = ?` — pure ledger, no cached balance needed at current scale (~500k rows before performance consideration, years away at community scale)
  - Add `created_at` index at schema creation time — enables clean range-based archiving later without schema changes: `CREATE INDEX idx_stonk_ledger_created ON stonk_ledger(created_at)`
- [ ] `stonk_balance` Postgres view: `SELECT user_id, SUM(amount) AS balance FROM stonk_ledger GROUP BY user_id`
- [ ] Add `stonk_balance` to `GET /api/auth/me` and `GET /api/users/:username/mini` responses (query the view)
- [ ] Add `chat_launched: false` to `stonk_config` as a feature flag — stonks display components check this flag and render nothing (not zero) until chat is live; flip to `true` when Phase 1 ships to avoid misleading zeroes on wiki profiles before the economy exists

#### Point Events (all instant, all write to `stonk_ledger`)
- [ ] Profile created: +50
- [ ] Wiki edit submitted (PR merged): +10
- [ ] Wiki page created: +25
- [ ] Received a kek reaction: +5
- [ ] Received a nahh reaction: -3 (floor: 0 — clamp in Worker before insert)
- [ ] Gave a nahh reaction: -1 to giver (configurable, default -1 — cost disincentivises spam)
- [ ] Gave a kek: +0 (giving keks is free, costs nothing)
- [ ] Other reaction emotes: configurable per-emote value (default 0, admins can set per emote)
- [ ] All values admin-configurable via a `stonk_config` table: `key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value INTEGER`

#### `stonk_config` table
- [ ] Seed default values for all point events above
- [ ] `GET /api/admin/stonk-config` — returns all config rows
- [ ] `PUT /api/admin/stonk-config` — body `{ key, value }`: update a config value; admin only

#### Frontend — Stonks Display
- [ ] Stonk balance + sparkline on `WikiProfilePage` (own profile) and public `/user/:username` page
- [ ] Stonk balance + small number on `MiniProfilePopup`
- [ ] Sparkline chart: lightweight SVG (uPlot or hand-rolled with D3 — D3 already in bundle) showing balance over time from `stonk_ledger` grouped by day
- [ ] `GET /api/users/:username/stonk-history` — returns daily balance snapshots (aggregate ledger by day) for charting
- [ ] Easter egg reactions: configurable per-emote `effect` field in `stonk_config` (e.g. `confetti`) — client reads effect from emote config and triggers animation; confetti via `canvas-confetti` (tiny, ~3KB)

> **Future note:** Secondary stonks market (users investing in other users' stonks, prediction-market style) — deliberately deferred. The ledger schema supports it without changes.

---

### Phase 3: Identity & Avatar

#### Wiki Profile Claiming (Supabase-backed)
- [ ] Create `chatter_claims` table: `user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles PRIMARY KEY, wiki_slug TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE, claimed_at TIMESTAMPTZ`
- [ ] `POST /api/chat/claim` — body `{ wiki_slug }`: verifies `username` frontmatter on the markdown file matches the authenticated user's username (fetch from `content-index.json`); inserts into `chatter_claims`; returns claim record
- [ ] `GET /api/users/:username/claim` — returns claimed wiki slug if exists
- [ ] On `WikiProfilePage` and public profile: show linked chatter wiki page if claim exists; show "Claim this wiki page" button if a matching `username` frontmatter exists but no claim yet
- [ ] On chatter wiki profile pages (`type: chatter`): show linked user account if claim exists; show "Is this you? Claim this page" button otherwise
- [ ] Logged-in users without a claim and without a matching wiki profile: show "Create your chatter profile" button → opens submit form (`/submit`) pre-filled with their username; submission still creates a PR (GitHub App token deferred)

#### Avatar Customisation
- [ ] Avatar customisation panel on `WikiProfilePage` — upload image or paste URL; stored in Supabase Storage bucket `avatars` (or URL stored in `profiles.avatar_url`)
- [ ] Avatar displayed in: chat `MessageRow`, `MiniProfilePopup`, wiki profile infobox (if claimed), `WikiShell` auth header

#### Idle Game (deferred — design note)
> Cookie-clicker / Universal Paperclips style idle mechanic. Idle rate scales with stonk level. Points calculated on login from `last_login` delta, capped at 24h accumulation. Avatar "collects" while away — client-side presentation of the delta. Full design TBD.

---

## Future / Low Priority
- [ ] Improve chess UI to match site themes, optimise WASM performance, public leaderboard (Stockfish has built-in support for this)
- [x] Typography: dropcaps (`.dropcap` / `data-dropcap`), pull quotes (`.pullquote` blockquote)
- [ ] GitHub App token for non-expiring wiki submissions — until then, add a Worker startup preflight: verify token validity on boot, return clear "wiki submissions temporarily unavailable" error to users rather than a silent 500 if token is expired
- [ ] Wiki community features (comments, reactions)

---

## Architecture Notes

- `src/content/` is auto-generated — never edit directly
- `src/worker.ts` is the CF Worker entry point — excluded from main tsconfig, compiled by wrangler independently
- `functions/` directory removed — API handled directly in `src/worker.ts`
- SPA routing: `wrangler.toml` `[assets]` + `not_found_handling = "single-page-application"` (not `_redirects`)
- `VITE_WIKI_MODE` must never be `true` in CF Pages build env vars
- Wiki submit route must appear before catch-all in `routeTree.addChildren()`
- `BgCanvas` at z-index 0 — all layout containers must be `background: transparent`
- MDX custom components (`Query`, `WikiSubmitForm`, `BookCard`, etc.) must be passed via `components` prop on `<MDXComponent>` in `NoteBody` as well as registered in `MDXProvider` — context alone is insufficient
- `contentPath` in content-index preserves original filename casing for `public/content/` fetches on CF's Linux filesystem
