# Digital Garden v2 — Roadmap

Custom React/Vite digital garden. Live at `subsurfaces.net`, wiki at `wiki.subsurfaces.net`.

---

## Completed

### Core Platform
- [x] React 19 + Vite 6 + TanStack Router + Zustand + SCSS modules
- [x] MDX build-time compilation via `@mdx-js/rollup` (120 notes)
- [x] Prebuild pipeline: content-index, graph, slug-map, music, folders, photography manifests
- [x] Catch-all routing with system page slugs (graph, chess, photography, bookshelf, movieshelf, music-library)
- [x] CF Workers deployment with custom domains (subsurfaces.net, www, wiki)

### Layout System
- [x] Article layout: 900px body, Tufte-style sidenotes, TOC, WikiInfobox for chatter/philosopher types
- [x] Note layout: exploration mode, panel stacking, link previews
- [x] Layout auto-resolution: frontmatter → type → slug prefix → default
- [x] `NoteRenderer` + `NoteBody` unified content loading

### Shell & Navigation
- [x] AppShell: BgCanvas + workspace + PanelStack + floating overlays
- [x] WikiShell: lean wiki subdomain shell (no BgCanvas, no music, no panels)
- [x] TerminalTitle: boot sequence, idle animations, wiki context support
- [x] CornerMenu: mobile arc menu with wiki variant
- [x] QuickControls: desktop top-right strip (music, search, theme, clock)
- [x] Panel system: capture-phase click interceptor, depth-aware trimming, card animations

### Features
- [x] BgCanvas: graph/vectors/dots/terminal/chess modes
- [x] Music player: persistent audio, FFT visualiser, mobile strip
- [x] Search: FlexSearch + Ctrl+K overlay
- [x] Graph: D3 force sim + PixiJS renderer, local radar + global overlay
- [x] Chess: chess.js + custom board + Stockfish WASM
- [x] Photography: masonry grid + lightbox
- [x] Collections: bookshelf, movieshelf, music library (auto-collected from frontmatter)
- [x] Theme system: dark/light toggle, ROYGBIV accent cycle, palette generation

### Wiki Subdomain
- [x] `wiki.subsurfaces.net` Worker custom domain configured
- [x] `useIsWiki` hook (hostname + VITE_WIKI_MODE detection)
- [x] WikiShell with BgCanvas, QuickControls, breadcrumb, simplified CornerMenu
- [x] Wiki content: index, Philosophers, Concepts, Movements, Chatters sections
- [x] Wiki index routing: `wiki.subsurfaces.net/` correctly resolves to `Wiki/index.md`
- [x] Case-insensitive `contentIndex` lookup via `resolveSlug` — fixes titles/metadata on all wiki pages

### Wiki Submission System
- [x] `src/worker.ts` — CF Worker entry point handles `POST /api/submit` (Turnstile + GitHub PR)
- [x] `WikiSubmitPage.tsx` — 4-step form: basic info → survey (35 questions) → page body editor → review
- [x] Survey dropdowns include "Other…" option with inline free-text input
- [x] Markdown editor with toolbar, word count, MDX syntax guide
- [x] Profile image: upload file or paste URL; committed to `content/Media/Wiki/chatters/` on PR branch
- [x] Draft save/load: `localStorage` auto-restore, download/upload `.json` draft file
- [x] Upload draft on step 1 — jumps straight to review step
- [x] Submissions create PR against `master` branch with `tags: [wiki, chatter]`
- [x] Turnstile + GitHub token configured in CF Worker runtime secrets
- [x] End-to-end submission verified in production

### Infrastructure
- [x] OG image generation: satori + @resvg/resvg-js, per-note thumbnail (cover/image/poster), description linting
- [x] OG meta tag injection in `src/worker.ts` — per-route `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `twitter:card`
- [x] Wiki subdomain gets "Philchat Wiki" branding in OG/title tags
- [x] `public/og/` gitignored — generated fresh at CF build time via `PROCESS_OG=true`
- [x] DNS: Cloudflare nameservers, Worker custom domains for all subdomains
- [x] SPA routing: `wrangler.toml` `[assets]` + `not_found_handling = "single-page-application"`
- [x] Default theme: light mode, blue accent (`#427ab4`)

## In Progress / Next Up

### Wiki Subdomain UX Fixes
- [x] **Submit page 404 in wiki subdomain**: added dedicated `/submit` route in router (before catch-all) rendering `WikiSubmitPage`
- [x] **Tag/folder pages unconstrained width in wiki**: removed `tags`/`folder` from article slug list in `resolveLayout`; also fixed `NoteBody` frontmatter override to not force article layout for tag/folder pages
- [x] **Search overlay links broken in wiki**: `handleSelect` now uses `navigate()` in wiki mode instead of `pushCard` (which requires PanelStack)
- [x] **TerminalTitle home button**: wiki logo now links to `/` (wiki root) instead of `https://subsurfaces.net`
- [x] **Tag/folder links not navigating in wiki**: `usePanelClick` was intercepting all clicks (hooks run before conditional shell return) — added `isWiki` bail-out so wiki lets links navigate normally
- [x] **Cross-domain backlinks broken in wiki**: backlinks to non-wiki slugs now link to `https://subsurfaces.net/{slug}` instead of `/{slug}`, preventing the wiki router from swallowing them

### Styling & UX Fixes
- [x] **TOC hash link fix**: `usePanelClick` intercepts `#hash` clicks — add early return for anchor links so TOC smooth-scrolls in both layouts
- [x] **Tag/Folder page headings**: add `<h1>` to TagPage and FolderPage (currently render lists with no heading)
- [x] **Infobox persistence bug**: WikiInfobox remains visible when navigating from a chatter/philosopher page to a non-infobox page — state not clearing on slug change
- [x] **Search overlay light mode**: styling broken in light theme
- [x] **Link preview simplification**: body content shown on hover (fetched from public/content/), recursive hover with depth cap, OPEN button pushes panel card
- [x] **Triadic colour harmony**: JS hue-rotation generates secondary/tertiary from accent; applied to callouts, blockquotes, growth badges, BgCanvas palette, TOC active state

### Wiki Content & Structure
- [x] **Wiki frontmatter cleanup**: add explicit `type` fields where semantically appropriate (chatters, philosophers); leave slug-based article rule as fallback
- [x] **Wiki tag taxonomy**: standardised tags (`philosopher`, `chatter`, `concept`, `movement`) on all wiki content; section links on index page route to `/tags/{type}`
- [x] **Wiki index redesign**: make it a proper hub page — section links (tag-based), recent additions, community stats
- [x] **Wiki page organisation**: establish standard wiki pages (index, about, guidelines, submit)

### Note Transclusion (Note Embeds)
- [x] **`![[Note]]` inline embed**: renders as styled `<aside class="note-embed">` block — header with label + link, body content, "open note" footer
- [x] **`![[Note#Section]]` heading-scoped embed**: extracts content under the specified heading at build time
- [x] **2-level depth limit**: `embedDepth` option prevents recursion beyond depth 2 (falls back to plain link)
- [x] **Broken embed detection**: warns at build time when `![[Target]]` cannot be resolved

### Content Features
- [x] **Reading time**: calculated at build time in prebuild, stored in content-index, shown in article header
- [x] **Broken link detection**: prebuild pass warns on `[[wikilinks]]` that don't resolve in slug-map; skips media file extensions and code-block/backtick-span false positives
- [x] **`contentPath` in index**: original relative path stored in content-index so runtime fetches use correct casing on CF's case-sensitive Linux filesystem
- [x] **Note aliases**: `aliases: [Name, AltName]` frontmatter → added to slug-map at prebuild, resolves from any alias
- [x] **`/recent` page**: notes sorted by `date` descending, similar to folder page layout
- [x] **Dataview-lite**: `<Query filter="type=book" sort="-date" limit="5" display="list|grid|table" />` MDX component — filters/sorts contentIndex at runtime, registered in MDXProvider; `<Query>` fix: components passed explicitly via props to bypass MDX context lookup issue

### UX Polish
- [x] **Breadcrumbs on articles**: `Folder / Subfolder / Note` derived from slug, shown above title in article layout
- [x] **Export / print styles**: `@media print` CSS — hides shell chrome, full-width content, sidenotes inline
- [x] **Hover previews**: body text fetched from `public/content/` using `contentPath` from index (preserves original filename casing); wikilinks rendered as hoverable `<a>` tags; first image shown as full-width header; HTML SPA-fallback rejection via `content-type` check; recursive hover to depth 4; OPEN button pushes panel card

### Dev Tools
- [x] **Properties editor redesign**: floating glass panel (bottom-right, no overlay, glassmorphism), session-override fields (title, type, tags)
- [x] **Admin consolidation**: DevDashboard already consolidates content index, note browser, store state, actions — using CSS variables throughout for light/dark support

### Typography & Content
- [x] **Tufte sidenotes in article layout**: `remarkSidenotes` plugin converts GFM footnotes (`[^1]`) at remark stage (rehype-level approach failed in MDX); injects `<aside class="sidenote">` after the containing block; floats into right margin at `>1101px`, checkbox toggle on narrow viewports
- [x] **Obsidian callouts**: `>[!type] Title` syntax renders as styled callout divs; fixed single-node collapse (remark-gfm collapses blockquote continuations into one `\n`-joined text node — plugin now splits on first `\n`)
- [x] **External link styling**: `href^="http"` links not pointing to `subsurfaces.net` get muted colour + `↗` superscript arrow; print stylesheet updated to show full URL only for external links
- [x] **WikiInfobox image expand**: clicking avatar opens fullscreen lightbox overlay; click backdrop to close; `cursor: zoom-in` hint
- [x] **`Writing/` slug → article layout**: `resolveLayout` now returns `article` for any `writing/` slug without needing `layout: article` in frontmatter (though frontmatter still wins)
- [x] **`rehypeImagePaths` double-prefix fix**: strips leading `media/` or `Media/` before prepending `/content/Media/` — prevents `media/media/` doubling when images are referenced from sidenotes or raw HTML
- [x] **Sample writing note**: `content/Writing/On-Attention.md` — demos dropcap, pullquote, callouts, sidenotes with wikilink + external link + image, `<Query>` component, `published: true` for RSS
- [x] **Writing template**: `content/Writing/Writing-Template.md` — style reference covering all supported features with inline examples
- [x] **Note embed HTML rendering**: embed body now parsed via `mdast-util-from-markdown` + `hast-util-to-html` — was injecting raw markdown as text
- [x] **EB Garamond dropcap**: loaded via Google Fonts; upright 400, `5.4em`, `clear: right` on pullquote prevents sidenote overlap; `z-index: 1` prevents text overlap
- [x] **`Query` filter key fix**: filter key is `tag=` not `tags=`; fixed in template and On-Attention

### Performance & Build
- [ ] **Chess performance**: investigate Stockfish WASM latency on local builds
- [ ] **Pre-render SSG**: build-time HTML generation for all notes
- [ ] **Image optimisation**: sharp WebP variants + `<picture>` srcsets
- [ ] **Lighthouse CI**: GitHub Actions target 95+ desktop
- [x] **Auto-deploy on merge**: CF Workers auto-builds on push via `wrangler.toml` `[build]` command — no GitHub Actions needed

### Content & SEO
- [x] **Sitemap** in prebuild (sitemap.xml → public/)
- [x] **`image` field in content-index**: extracted from frontmatter (`image`/`cover`/`poster`) for OG and meta use
- [x] **RSS feeds (two, opt-in)**: `public/rss.xml` (Writing/ or `published: true`, non-wiki) + `public/wiki-rss.xml` (wiki/ + `published: true`); both generated in prebuild; `published` extracted into content-index; undated notes excluded; fixed wiki feed link text to say `wiki.subsurfaces.net`. `content/Writing/` folder ready — add notes there or set `published: true` + `date` on any note to include it.
- [ ] **Detailed documentation**: comprehensive docs for the codebase (delegate to worker agent)

## Comments System

Opt-in per-note comments. Turnstile-gated, no login required. Pseudonymous (name only). Stored in Cloudflare D1 via the existing Worker. Hierarchical replies, upvote/downvote. Available site-wide (wiki + main), styled to match the active shell.

### D1 Database Setup
- [ ] Create D1 database via Wrangler: `npx wrangler d1 create digital-garden-comments`
- [ ] Add `[[d1_databases]]` binding to `wrangler.toml`: `binding = "DB", database_name = "digital-garden-comments"`
- [ ] Add `DB: D1Database` to `Env` interface in `src/worker.ts`
- [ ] Run schema migration via `wrangler d1 execute`:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE comments (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    slug TEXT NOT NULL,
    parent_id TEXT,
    author TEXT NOT NULL,
    body TEXT NOT NULL,
    upvotes INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    downvotes INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL
  );
  CREATE INDEX idx_comments_slug ON comments(slug);
  ```

### Worker API Endpoints (src/worker.ts)
- [ ] `GET /api/comments?slug=...` — fetch all comments for a slug (ordered by created_at, tree structure assembled client-side)
- [ ] `POST /api/comments` — submit a new comment: validate Turnstile token, validate name + body (non-empty, length limits), insert into D1, return created comment
- [ ] `POST /api/comments/:id/vote` — body `{ dir: 1 | -1 }`: increment upvotes or downvotes on a comment row
- [ ] `DELETE /api/comments/:id` — admin-only delete: requires `Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_SECRET>` header; add `ADMIN_SECRET` to Worker secrets
- [ ] Add `ADMIN_SECRET` to Worker runtime secrets in CF dashboard

### Frontend — CommentSection Component
- [ ] Create `src/components/ui/CommentSection.tsx`:
  - Fetches comments on mount via `GET /api/comments?slug={slug}`
  - Assembles flat list into tree (parent_id → children) client-side
  - Renders top-level comments first (oldest first, LessWrong style)
  - Each comment shows: author, relative timestamp, body, upvote/downvote buttons, reply button
  - Upvote/downvote calls `POST /api/comments/:id/vote` and updates count optimistically
  - Reply button opens inline reply form below the comment
  - Submit form at the bottom of the comment list (top-level new comment)
- [ ] Create `src/components/ui/CommentSection.module.scss` — styled to CSS variables, works in both dark/light, both shells
- [ ] Submit form fields: Name (text, required), Comment (textarea, required), Turnstile widget, Submit button
- [ ] Inline reply form: same fields, nested visually under parent
- [ ] Loading + error states

### Integration
- [ ] Add `comments?: boolean` to `NoteMetadata` in `src/types/content.ts`
- [ ] Extract `comments` field in `scripts/prebuild.ts` (add to `NoteMeta`, write to content-index)
- [ ] In `NoteRenderer.tsx`: if `meta?.comments` is true, render `<CommentSection slug={slug} />` below `<NoteFooter>`
- [ ] `CommentSection` uses `useIsWiki()` to determine which domain's API to call (both domains share the same Worker, so `/api/comments` works on both)

### Opt-in
- [ ] Add `comments: true` to any note frontmatter to enable the section
- [ ] Suggested initial candidates: `content/Wiki/index.md`, chatter profiles

---

## Future / Low Priority
- [ ] Improve chess UI to match site themes, optimise WASM performance, public leaderboard (Stockfish has built-in support for this)
- [x] Typography: dropcaps (`.dropcap` / `data-dropcap`), pull quotes (`.pullquote` blockquote)
- [ ] GitHub App token for non-expiring wiki submissions
- [ ] Wiki community features (comments, reactions)

---

## Architecture Notes

- `src/content/` is auto-generated — never edit directly
- `src/worker.ts` is the CF Worker entry point — excluded from main tsconfig, compiled by wrangler independently
- `functions/` directory removed — API handled directly in `src/worker.ts`
- SPA routing: `wrangler.toml` `[assets]` + `not_found_handling = "single-page-application"` (not `_redirects`)
- `VITE_WIKI_MODE` must never be `true` in CF Pages build env vars
- Wiki submit route must appear before catch-all in `routeTree.addChildren()`
- `BgCanvas` at z-index 0 — all layout containers must be `background: transparent`
- MDX custom components (`Query`, `WikiSubmitForm`, `BookCard`, etc.) must be passed via `components` prop on `<MDXComponent>` in `NoteBody` as well as registered in `MDXProvider` — context alone is insufficient
- `contentPath` in content-index preserves original filename casing for `public/content/` fetches on CF's Linux filesystem
